# Tennis coding test

## Getting Started

#### Initial setup

After cloning the repo, run:

```sh
yarn install
```

#### Run sample match

This will execute the sample match found at `src/play-match.ts`.
If left unchanged, this will play the 1st set of Federer vs Nadal's 4th game at Wimbledon 2019.

```sh
yarn play-match
```

#### Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Assumptions

- No input validation.
- Only a single set is explicitly supported.
